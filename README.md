# Intermediate-Data-Analysis-Course-Project
This repository will contain files pertaining to an Intermediate Data Analysis course Final

1.) The first file to read will be the Math 439 Final word document. It contains information about our data sets and the problems we wish to provide insight on.

2.) Our csv files are our data sets used to find solutions to our 2 problems mentioned in our word document.

3.) The Math 439 Final Report pdf is my solutions to the problems at hand. I used R in Rstudio to create all models, visuals, and the report itself. The report ended up earning a     perfect score on the final.
